# Frontend
## Framework
React is used as front-end framework in the implementation.

Most of the components are written as functional component with hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`.

`React.useContext` is used for state control like authentication and back-end access. `Redux` is **not** used in this implementation to avoid extra 3rd package dependency.
